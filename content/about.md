Hey Fenil here!

I am an undergraduate student at Vellore Institute Of Technology.

I mostly like to work on low-level stuff like compilers, programming language design, etc. Currently I am interning in Dyte Inc. as a backend intern, in my free time I give back to community by contributing to various open source projects.
